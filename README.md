## Hypothesis
Searching for the worst case scenario with fixed matrices of varying sizes should result in a linear runtime. 

## Background 
We are using fixed matrices that vary in size for our experiment. The plots for each slot will increment by 1.

Example: A 4x4 matrix will look like this   
|0   1  2  3    
|4   5  6  7   
|8   9  10 11  
|12 13 14 15  

## Experimental Methology
Our experimental apparatus is to populate various set matrixes from sizes of 1000 to 10000, increasing in size by 100 every iteration. We will conduct a search for the worst case scenario each time, the bottom left most location, 10 times each for every iteration. The 10 runs will be averaged into one value for that matrix size. This way we will have a consistent search method each time.
