## Hypothesis
We believe that the results will show a linear search algotithm. 

## Background 
We are using fixed arrays that vary in size for our experiment. The plots for each slot will increment by 1.

Example:   
|0 1 2 3 ... # of columns  
|1 2 3 4  
|2 3 4 5   
|3 4 5 6   
|4 5 6 7  
|...  
|# of rows  

## Experimental Methology
Our experimental apparatus is to populate various set matrixes from 0 to n-1, decreasing in size with different iteratoins. We will conduct a search for the worst case scenario each time, the bottom most left location. This way we will have a consistent search method each time. 

## Results 
<In progress>  

## Conclusions 
<In progress>
